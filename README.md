# risk-range-vol_of_vol
Using rough volatility https://tpq.io/p/rough_volatility_with_python.html 

I've tried to comment the code for usage.  

The code uses dataframes for the OHLC data.  In the td_calc function, I use another lib to pull in the data and place in 
a dataframe using the dataframe named dmt. 

This risk range here are for your viewing and usage.  They do not match and can use addtional work to optimize. Please share any updates and improvements.
